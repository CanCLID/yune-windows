# Decisions

This file records standing product decisions for Yune Windows.

## Standing Decisions

### D-01 - Yune-only runtime

Yune Windows uses Yune as the only runtime engine. A librime fallback would keep
old architecture debt alive and make product bugs harder to classify.

### D-02 - Fresh public repo with reference extraction

The product starts in this fresh public repo. The legacy Weasel-derived
implementation is reference material, not the product architecture. Reuse small
proven TSF, IPC, server, installer, smoke, and candidate-positioning pieces only
after they are audited.

### D-03 - Shared server/IPC by default

The default process model is a shared server/IPC spine because it matches
Yune's process-global runtime/session/userdb model. In-process TSF-per-app
loading must win an explicit spike before it replaces the default.

### D-04 - Native first candidate window

The inline candidate window starts native. WebView2 can be evaluated for
settings and dictionary-panel UI, but not for the latency-critical inline
candidate window until focus, positioning, accessibility, and latency are
proven.

### D-05 - Privacy gates from the first host contract

The host contract reserves sensitive-context behavior from the start. Password
or secure TSF contexts suppress learning, AI staging, and typed-content logs.

### D-06 - Engine and product evidence stay separate

Windows product evidence does not close Yune engine-performance milestones.
Yune engine evidence does not prove Windows product readiness.

### D-07 - No blocker closeout for live readiness

Dogfood readiness is a product-readiness gate, not a diagnosis-only gate. A
measured TSF, installer, candidate-window, or cleanup blocker is recorded as
evidence, then implementation continues or the gate stays open.

## Last Updated

2026-06-27 - Renamed the Windows IME product baseline to Yune Windows for the
clean public `CanCLID/yune-windows` repo.
